  Hi! I'm Sydney. <br>

  This website is a catch-all for things I'm writing, projects I've been working on, and
  other miscellaneous stuff. You can read a little about my philosophy for building a personal website
  here.
</p>

<h3> past </h3>
<p>
  I studied math, economics and philosophy at the University of Arizona, where
  I was also awarded a FLAS Fellowship for advanced study in Arabic.
  Before starting college I spent a year working on organic farms around the northeastern U.S.
</p><p>

  My first job out of college was in a macro-finance research group at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
  and before that I interned at NASA Langley Research Center for a year. </p>

<h3> present </h3>
I'm currently working as a researcher at a
hedge fund. I'm interested in markets,
  effective altruism, and improving the long-term future.

<h3> future </h3>


</p>
<h2>things I think about a lot:</h2>
<p>
  <li> market microstructure (a.k.a. how the rules of markets, especially financial markets,
  impact participant behavior) </li>
  <li> progress studies (a.k.a. what are the conditions under which technological progress happens and
  how can we replicate them)</li>
  <li> effective altruism (a.k.a. what do we value most and how can we maximize that value)</li>
  <li> how capital markets interact with economic growth and technological progress</li>
  <li> overly systematic ways of enjoying things like food and perfume
</p>
