I currently work in finance.

I like logical thinking. I studied math, economics and philosophy at the University of Arizona, where I was also a FLAS Fellow in Arabic.

Before starting college, I worked on several organic farms around the northeastern U.S. where I learned to grow (and cook and eat) lots of good food.
