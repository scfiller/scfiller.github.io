<h2> about </h2>
<p>
  Hi! I'm Sydney. <br>

  I'm currently working in a research group at a hedge fund. I'm interested in markets,
  effective altruism, progress and the long-term future.

  This website is a catch-all for things I'm writing, projects I've been working on, and
  other miscellaneous stuff. You can read a little about my philosophy for building a personal website
  here.
</p>

<h2> background </h2>
<p>
  I studied math, economics and philosophy at the University of Arizona, where I was also awarded
  a FLAS Fellowship for advanced study in Arabic. Before starting college I worked on several organic farms around the northeastern
  U.S. where I learned a lot about growing and cooking excellent food.

  My first job out of college was in a macro-finance research group at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
  and before that I interned at NASA Langley Research Center for a year.
</p>
<h2>things I think about a lot:</h2>
<p>
  <li> market microstructure (a.k.a. how the rules of markets, especially financial markets,
  impact participant behavior) </li>
  <li> progress studies (a.k.a. what are the conditions under which technological progress happens and
  how can we replicate them)</li>
  <li> effective altruism (a.k.a. what do we value most and how can we maximize that value)</li>
  <li> how financial institutions and markets interact with economic growth and technological progress</li>

  Other than work, I enjoy reading (especially science fiction) and overly ambitious cooking projects.
