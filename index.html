Hi! I'm Sydney.

  This website is a catch-all for things I'm interested in, projects I've been working on, and
  other miscellaneous stuff. You can read a little about my philosophy for building a personal website
  here.

<p>

  I graduated with B.A.s in math, economics and philosophy at the University of Arizona, where I was also awarded
  a FLAS Fellowship to study Arabic. Before starting college I worked on several organic farms around the northeastern
  U.S. where I learned a lot about growing and cooking excellent food.

  My first job out of college was in a macro-finance research group at the Federal Reserve, and I currently
  work in a research group at a hedge fund. Before starting full-time work I interned at NASA Langley Research
  Center for a year.

  Things I think about a lot:
  - market microstructure (a.k.a. how the rules of markets, especially financial markets,
  impact participant behavior)
  - progress studies (a.k.a. what are the conditions under which technological progress happens and
  how can we replicate them)
  - effective altruism (a.k.a. what do we value most and how can we maximize that value)
  - how financial institutions and markets interact with economic growth and technological progress

  Other than work, I enjoy reading (especially science fiction) and overly ambitious cooking projects.
