Please rate things more harshly!

Like many people, I'm interested in finding high-quality things. I rely on others'
judgment to do this. I've since learned that many people have excellent judgment
but a poor ability to express their judgmen

## What's the point of rating things?

Rating systems do two things: they provide coarse signals of quality to buyers
and incentivize sellers to produce high-quality goods.
## What are the problems with rating things?
People don't accurately represent their preferences.
People's preferences change over time--somewhat unavoidable.
Aggregation problems.
## Best rating strategies
Pareto-optimal rating systems exist, but face the familiar problem of preference
aggregation on the raters' side (Pareto optimality here meaning the maximum of
  buyers' and sellers' payoffs, in addition to the payoffs of the rating service
  provider)

We're all familiar with cardinal ratings (five stars), ordinal ratings (rankings,
  or is x better than y), binary ratings (thumbs up/thumbs down)
## Because no one will follow the best rating strategies, what should you do?
- I try to seek out "mean" raters
- Rely on your friends
- Think of cardinal ratings as "thumbs up" or "thumbs down"

## Why don't prices reflect ratings? Why don't I pay *more* for a five-star book?

Appendix
Funny knock-on effects: ratings algorithms become less effect over time;
adverse selection spiral

experiment:
does being a mean rater improve your odds of success (i.e.)

### Addendum
Why write about ratings systems? Ratings systems of all sorts (academic grading,
  bond/credit ratings, etc.) represent one of my favorite features of economics,
  which is that if we set up clever structures that facilitate the sharing of information,
  suddenly we've unlocked some magical thing called *surplus*.
