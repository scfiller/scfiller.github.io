### present
I'm broadly interested in what people online call "progress studies", especially
the history of economic though and the evolution of financialized economies. I love perfumes, really good food, and trying out a bunch of different sports (currently very into squash).
I live in NYC and work as a researcher at a hedge fund, which I really
enjoy.

### past
I graduated college in 2021 with degrees in math, economics and philosophy.
One of the highlights of my college career was doing debate (British parliamentary/
  Worlds), which introduced me to a lot of very smart-curious-competitive people
  who thought differently than I did.
My family moved around frequently growing up but I spent
most of my life in Mons, Belgium and Tucson, Arizona.

### future
{% marginnote "mn-id-contact" "email: sydney.f.claire@gmail.com" %}
ideally:
- building community (and hopefully a family) in nyc
- working on something macroecon related and/or something startup-y
- cooking, watching a lot of good movies, writing more
