### past & present
I graduated college in 2021 with degrees in math, economics and philosophy.
My family moved around frequently growing up but I spent
most of my life in Mons, Belgium and Tucson, Arizona.

I'm broadly interested in what people online call "progress studies", especially
the history of economic thought and the evolution of financialized economies.
I live in NYC and currently work as a researcher at a hedge fund, which I really
enjoy.

## future
ideally:
- building community (and maybe a family?) in nyc
- working on something macroecon related and/or something startup-y
- cooking, watching a lot of good movies, trying to write more
- ???
