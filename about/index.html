I'm Sydney!
<h3> past </h3>
I graduated college in 2021 with degrees in math, economics and philosophy.
Growing up, my family moved around frequently, but
I spent most of my life in Mons, Belgium and Tucson, Arizona.
<br>
I was raised Catholic but became an atheist after I was confirmed around age 13.
Before starting college I took a gap year to work on organic farms
around the northeastern U.S., where I met a bunch of Quakers, decided to convert
and turned a gap year into a gap two years.
<h3> present </h3>
I no longer
consider myself a Quaker and have a less
straightforward relationship with religion now, but I find myself drawn to the
history and influence of Christianity and Judaism on Western history and enjoy reading and thinking
about religion seriously (I really, really like C.S. Lewis).
<br>
<br>
I'm broadly interested in what people online call "progress studies", especially
the history of economic thought and the evolution of financialized economies.
I live in NYC and currently work as a researcher at a hedge fund, which I really
enjoy.
<br>
<h3> future </h3>
ideally:
<br>
- building community (and maybe a family?) in nyc <br>
- working on something macroecon related and/or something startup-y <br>
- cooking, watching a lot of good movies, trying to write more <br>
- ???
