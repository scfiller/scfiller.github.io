I'm a research analyst in the Capital Markets group at Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Before joining the Fed, I interned at NASA for a year and participated in the American Institute of Mathematics' summer colloquium on COVID-19 modeling.

I studied math, economics and philosophy at the University of Arizona, where I was also awarded a FLAS Fellowship to study Arabic. I wrote some advice on how to make the most of college, especially for those attending large universities.

In a past life I worked on a few organic farms around the northeastern U.S. and learned a lot about growing (and cooking and eating) good food.
