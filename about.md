Hi! I'm Sydney.

In general, I like thinking about markets of all sorts and how they work. I started my career at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York where I worked in a macro-finance research group and I've since moved to a research group at a hedge fund.

In a past life, I worked on several organic farms around the northeastern U.S. before starting college. I studied mathematics, economics and philosophy at the University of Arizona, where I was also awarded a FLAS Fellowship to study Arabic.

I wrote a little here on why I think having personal websites is useful and how I think about structuring mine.
Test.
