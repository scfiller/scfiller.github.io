I work in finance and live in NYC.

I like logical thinking. I studied math, economics and philosophy at the University of Arizona, where I was also a FLAS Fellow in Arabic.

Before I started college, I worked on a few organic farms around the northeastern U.S. and learned a lot about growing (and cooking and eating) good food.
