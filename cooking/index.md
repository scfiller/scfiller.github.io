# cooking
{% newthought 'Keeping' %} track of recipe modifications and useful techniques is a great way to quickly improve at cooking. It's really easy to forget small changes that push a dish from "good" to "great", so I started taking notes on recipe modifications I made. Almost all of the recipes here are adapted (some lightly, some very heavily) from great cooks, and all credit goes to them.
