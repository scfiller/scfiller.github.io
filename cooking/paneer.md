<li> 1. Heat one gallon of fresh cow's milk to 185F in a large pot, stirring constantly to avoid scalding the milk. Once at 185F, hold the milk at this temperature for 25 minutes. </li>
<li> 2. Allow the milk to cool to 170F. Add 5g/1tsp of powdered citric acid to 475ml/16oz of 170F water.</li>
</ol>

<li> 3. While gently stirring with one hand, slowly add diluted citric acid to the milk. Continue stirring until you see curd separation.</li>
<li> 4. Once the curds have separated, cover the pot and let rest undisturbed for 20 minutes. </li>
<li> 5. Line a sterilized colander with cheesecloth and place the colander over a large bowl to collect the whey. Start ladling the whey collected at the surface into the colander. Once most of the whey has been removed, gently ladle the curds into the colander. Drain for 30 minutes. </li>
<li> 6. Twist the cloth into a ball to force whey from the curds. Place a plate or lid over the curd and rest something heavy (a pot of water works well!) over the plate to continue pressing the whey out. Press for 10-15 minutes or until the paneer reaches your desired firmness. </li>
