<h2> Ingredients: </h2>
<ol>
<li>140g dried chickpeas</li>
<li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
<li>750g water</li>
<li>3 tbsp fresh lemon juice, more or less to taste</li>
<li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
<li>50g ice cold water</li>
<li>180g tahini</li>
<li>salt to taste</li>
</ol>

<h2> Instructions </h2>
<ol>
<li> 1. Soak dried chickpeas in water for 16-24 hours. The chickpeas should split easily when squeezed and have one homogenous color throughout (no dried center visible). </li>
<li> 2. In a separate pot or a kettle, boil 750ml of water. This can be done concurrently with heating the chickpeas. The goal is to immediately begin boiling the chickpeas after they've been gently cooked. </li>
<li> 3. Drain the chickpeas and put them into a pot (don't add water yet!). Add the baking soda and cook, stirring constantly, over high heat for three minutes. </li>
<li> 4. Add the boiling water and turn the heat down. Cook until the chickpeas fall apart easily under a fork, approximately 20-40 minutes. </li>
<li> 5. Drain the chickpeas (which should weigh around 200g by now) and reserve a small handful for garnish. Pulse the lemon juice and garlic in the food processor (pureeing garlic in lemon juice prevents it from becoming bitter). Add the chickpeas and puree until you get a stiff paste, then add the tahini. Puree for a minute, then slowly add water, salt and extra lemon juice to taste. </li>
<li> 6. Garnish with reserved chickpeas and olive oil. Dried sumac, parsley, paprika and chili flakes all (individually) make great garnishes. </li>
