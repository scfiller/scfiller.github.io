{% marginfigure 'mf-id-roti' "..\cooking\img\roti.png"%}

## Ingredients
- 600g all-purpose flour
- 20g sugar
- 35g ghee (melted)
- 12g salt
- 60g sweetened condensed milk
- 300g 75F/24C lukewarm water
- Neutral oil to help with shaping

### Directions

## dough
- Combine water, milk, ghee, salt and sugar in a large bowl; stir to combine.
- Add flour, stir with a spatula, and knead with hands until the dough comes together (just until the dry dough is incorporated). Add a few extra teaspoons of water to hydrate excess dry flour.
- Cover and rest for 15 minutes
- Knead until smooth for about 30 seconds
- Divide dough into 10 portions of 100g each, shape dough into a smooth tight ball, and generously coat each dough ball in oil. Cover and rest balls for 2-3 hours at room temperature or overnight in the fridge. If refrigerating, remove from the fridge and leave at room temperature for 1 hour before proceeding.

## shaping
1. On a LARGE surface (clean glass tables, large pastry mat, clean kitchen island), begin to stretch the dough balls by rolling them out, sticking one corner of the dough to the table, and pulling gently to stretch.

Roti canai freeze amazingly well. Once rolled and shaped, stack the roti in layers separated by parchment paper and freeze in a Ziploc bag.

## cook
1. Add a few tablespoons of ghee, butter or oil. Once melted and shimmering, place the roti in and cook until golden brown, pressing lightly with a spatula to cook evenly.
2. Flip, cook until both sides are golden. Add in another tablespoon of butter to the pan, swirl, flip once more to coat both sides of the roti.
3. Place roti on tea towel and cool for 30 seconds. Then, using the tea towel to protect your hands, clap the roti until it's fluffy and flakey.

## curry

1. Add 1/2 of the coconut milk to a small pot, set to medium heat and reduce coconut milk until it's thick, bubbly and the coconut oil starts to separate and sizzle (~5 minutes).

2. Add curry past, stir together with the coconut milk and cook until a red oil separates (~1-2 minutes). Add turmeric and five spice. Stir and cook for another ~30 seconds.

3. Add the remaining coconut milk, water, and fish sauce. Cook for ~5 minutes with occasional stirring.

4. Add sugar. The consistency should be relatively thin, like crepe batter. Add salt to taste. Serve right away.
