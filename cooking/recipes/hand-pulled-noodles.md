{% marginfigure 'mf-id-noodles' "..\cooking\img\hand-pulled-noodles.png"%}
## Ingredients
### noodles
*serves two generously*
- 200g bread flour
-- using high-protein flour is important here! i used king arthur bread flour
which has ~12.7% protein compared to king arthur all purpose flour, which has
~11.7% protein
- 1.5g / 1/2 tsp salt
- 100g water (room temperature)
- ~50g olive oil/3 tbsp for coating dough during resting; no need to be overly exact

### chili oil topping
- 2 garlic cloves (large), minced, add more garlic if you're a real one
- 2-4 leaves finely chopped Napa cabbage
- 30g sichuan red chili flakes or aleppo pepper flakes
- 5g sichuan peppercorn powder
- ~75g peanut oil

### noodle sauce
1. 120ml soy sauce

## Directions
### noodles
1. Thoroughly mix salt and flour. Mixing with your hands, slowly add water until the dough is evenly hydrated.
2. Knead for ~1 minute, then cover and rest for 30 minutes.
3. Knead the dough for 2 minutes, then roll the dough into a log. Cut the dough into 4 separate pieces, giving each a quick knead, and roll into small logs.
4. Generously coat the logs with oil, cover and rest for two hours.
5. When the noodles are almost done resting, bring a large pot of water to a boil. The noodles should be able to move freely around in the water, and there should be enough heat capacity to remain at a rolling boil after dropping the noodles in, so be generous with the amount of water here!
6. On a large, clean work surface, take a log of dough and slightly roll it out until the log is a little flatted and expanded in size abut 25%.
7. Press a chopstick into the center of the dough, creating a small indentation into the first ~50% of the dough.
8. Grab each end of the dough log with your hands. In a fluid motion, move your hands up and down and move your hands apart, stretching the dough. The center of the dough log should stick slightly to the table, which helps it stretch. Keep stretching and moving your hands up and down until the noodle has stretched to about 1-2ft in length.
9. Tear the noodle dough down the middle using the indentation made earlier.
10. Place immediately into boiling water and boil for ~2 minutes. It should be chewy when you take it out of the water.

*note: the dough should be smooth and extremely stretchy after a 2 hour rest. if you're having a hard time pulling it, or the dough retracts after you roll it out slightly, rest it more first.*

### chili oil topping
1. While the noodles are boiling, heat oil to ~215 degrees celsius (smoke point),
then take off heat.  
2. Put the boiled noodles in a bowl and place garlic, chili flakes, cabbage, and peppercorn
powder in the middle.
3. Pour hot oil over the ingredients, toss and add noodle sauce.

### noodle sauce
1. While the dough is resting, combine all ingredients into a saucepan with
60g water. Bring to a boil.
2. Cook for 2 minutes at a boil, then turn off heat and let rest for 20-30 minutes.
3. Cool and store in your fridge.
