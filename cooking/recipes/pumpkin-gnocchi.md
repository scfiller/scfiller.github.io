# pumpkin gnocchi
{% marginfigure 'mf-id-gnocchi' "..\cooking\img\pumpkin_gnocchi.png"%}
## Ingredients

### Gnocchi
- 200g all-purpose flour
- 100g pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling!)
- 100g boiled potato, mashed or blended without skin
- 35g ricotta cheese
- 1 egg yolk (buy humanely raised eggs)
- 4g salt

### Brown Butter & Sage Sauce
- 3-4 tbsp unsalted butter
- 3 tbsp milk solids
- 6-7 fresh sage leaves (don’t use dried sage)

## Directions

1. Whisk together flour and salt. Add pumpkin puree, potatoes, egg yolk, and ricotta. Mix until homogeneous. Make sure the potato is pureed as finely as possible.
2. Roll into a log, then gently roll out until you have a tube about 1” in diameter. Cut gnocchi with a bench scraper.
3. If you want to make pumpkins, roll into balls and indent the sides with toothpicks. Use sage stems for pumpkin stems. Refrigerating gnocchi before boiling helps maintain their shape.
4. Place into boiling water and remove gnocchi once floating (4-5 minutes at most).

### For the Brown Butter Sauce

1. Melt butter in a pan over low heat. Add milk solids (these give browned butter the “browned butter” flavor and make this recipe go craaaaazy) and sage. Remove when solids are browned (2-3 minutes).
2. Toss in gnocchi and serve.
