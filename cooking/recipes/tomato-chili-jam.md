title: Tomato Chili Jam

## Ingredients
- 800g tomatoes, either fresh and roughly chopped (preferred) or canned
- 60g fresh ginger, grated
- 15g grated garlic
- 8g (2-3) green chilis (for low to medium spice tolerance, 4-5 for high spice tolerance), finely chopped
- 145ml rice vinegar (also try experimenting with white or apple cider vinegar)
- 300g sugar
- pinch salt (optional)
- 1/4tsp xanthan gum (optional)
- 1/4 cup fish sauce (optional)

## Instructions
1. Blitz tomatoes, ginger, garlic, chilis in blender until you have a fine puree.*
2. Pour the blended mixture into a pan, add sugar, and reduce over low-medium heat, stirring frequently, until very thick. (approx. 30 minutes)
3. Add a pinch of xanthan gum in the last minute of two of stirring for extra thickness.**
4. Pour into sterilized jars and refrigerate. Technically the pH of this mixture is low enough to can these, but (for me) it's more trouble than it's worth, and also I went through this jam very quickly. If canning, refrigerate after opening.

*I think this jam might benefit from being strained through a fine sieve, but I haven't tried it yet.

**Xanthan gum isn't necessary for a great jam, but I had some lying around and tried experimenting. I'll probably experiment with pectin or another thickener when I make this jam again.
