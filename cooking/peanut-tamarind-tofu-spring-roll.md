# Peanut Tamarind Tofu Spring Rolls
<i> recipe lightly adapted from [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/peanut-tamarind-dipping-sauce-spring-roll-satay-recipe)</i> <br>

## Ingredients
### Sauce
1. 170g peanuts
2. 30g cane sugar
3. 6 cloves garlic
4. 4 tbsp soy sauce
5. 2 tbsp tamarind concentrate (tamarind puree works here too)
6. 2 tbsp olive oil
7. 4 tbsp Thai red curry paste
8. 2+ tbsp coconut aminos (a sweeter, richer, less umami soy sauce replacement)
9. Small squeeze of lime juice, to taste

### Spring Roll
1. 7-10 rice paper sheets
2. 400g extra firm tofu
3. Bean sprouts
4. Pea shoots (tender greens are preferable because they're more flexible and less likely to tear the rice paper, but anything works!)
5. Finely julienned carrots
6. Finely diced serrano pepper
7. Chopped peanuts
8. Cilantro, Thai basil and mint

## Directions
1. Put the garlic and sugar in a food processor and blend until homogenous. Add peanuts and blend again.
2. Add soy sauce, tamarind, olive oil, curry paste and 1 tbsp coconut aminos.
3. Reserve half the sauce. Use one half to marinate the fried tofu. Thin the other half with more coconut aminos to create a dipping sauce.
4. Julienne the tofu into 2inx1/2in wide rectangles. Fry lightly in olive oil for 10 minutes, flipping halfway through. Toss in peanut tamarind sauce.
5. Combine all ingredients and roll into spring rolls.
